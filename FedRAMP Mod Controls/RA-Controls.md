#13.14 Risk Assessment (RA)
## RA-1 Risk Assessment Policy and Procedures (L) (M)
The organization:
  (a)	Develops, documents, and disseminates to [_Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles_]:
    (1)	A risk assessment policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (2)	Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the risk assessment policy and associated risk assessment controls; and
  (b)	Reviews and updates the current:
    (1)	Risk assessment policy [_FedRAMP Assignment: at least every three (3) years_]; and
    (2)	Risk assessment procedures [_FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually_].

## RA-2 Security Categorization (L) (M) (H)
The organization:
  (a)	Categorizes information and the information system in accordance with applicable Federal Laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance;
  (b)	Documents the security categorization results (including supporting rationale) in the security plan for the information system; and
  (c)	Ensures the security categorization decision is reviewed and approved by the AO or authorizing official designated representative.

## RA-3 Risk Assessment (L) (M)
The organization:
  (a)	Conducts an assessment of risk, including the likelihood and magnitude of harm, from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the information system and the information it processes, stores, or transmits;
  (b)	Documents risk assessment results in [Selection: security plan; risk assessment report; [_FedRAMP Assignment: security assessment report]_];
  (c)	Reviews risk assessment results [_FedRAMP Assignment: in accordance with OMB A-130 requirements or when a significant change occurs_];
  (d)	Disseminates risk assessment results to [_Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles_]; and
  (e)	Updates the risk assessment [_FedRAMP Assignment: in accordance with OMB A-130 requirements or when a significant change occurs_] or whenever there are significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security state of the system.

*RA-3 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:*
*Guidance:* Significant change is defined in NIST Special Publication 800-37 Revision 1, Appendix F

*RA-3 (d) Requirement:* Include the Authorizing Official; for JAB authorizations to include FedRAMP.

## RA-5 Vulnerability Scanning (L) (M) (H)
The organization:
  (a)	Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications [_FedRAMP Assignment: monthly operating system/infrastructure; monthly web applications and databases_] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported;
  (b)
*RA-5 (a) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:*
*Requirement:* An accredited independent assessor scans operating systems/infrastructure, web applications, and databases once annually.
  (c)	Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that promote interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
    (1)	Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
    (2)	Formatting and making transparent, checklists and test procedures; and
    (3)	Measuring vulnerability impact;
  (d)	Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments
  (e)	Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities; [_FedRAMP Assignment: high-risk vulnerabilities mitigated within thirty (30) days from date of discovery; moderate risk vulnerabilities mitigated within ninety (90) days from date of discovery_], in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and
  (f)	Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments with [_Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles_] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).
*RA-5 (e) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:*
*Requirement:* To include the Risk Executive; for JAB authorizations to include FedRAMP ISSOs.

### RA-5 (1) Control Enhancement (M) (H)
The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily update the list of information system vulnerabilities to be scanned.

### RA-5 (2) Control Enhancement (M) (H)
The organization updates the information system vulnerabilities scanned [_Selection (one or more): [_FedRAMP Assignment: prior to a new scan]_].
