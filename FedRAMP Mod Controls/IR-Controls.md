  (a)	Establishes a direct, cooperative relationship between its incident response capability and external providers of information system protection capability; and
  (b)	Identifies organizational incident response team members to the external providers.

## IR-8 Incident Response Plan (L) (M) (H)
The organization:
  (a)	Develops an incident response plan that:
    (1)	Provides the organization with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability;
    (2)	Describes the structure and organization of the incident response capability;
    (3)	Provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability fits into the overall organization;
    (4)	Meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission, size, structure, and functions;
    (5)	Defines reportable incidents;
    (6)	Provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the organization;
    (7)	Defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature an incident response capability; and
    (8)	Is reviewed and approved by [_Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles_];
  (b)	Distributes copies of the incident response plan to [_FedRAMP Assignment: see additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance_].
*IR-8(b) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:*
*Requirement:* The service provider defines a list of incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements.  The incident response list includes designated FedRAMP personnel.
  (c)	Reviews the incident response plan [_FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually_];
  (d)	Updates the incident response plan to address system/organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing;
  (e)	Communicates incident response plan changes to [_FedRAMP Assignment: see additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance_].
