## 3. Procedures
### 3.1.	Security Assessments
#### 3.1.1.	Preparation
#### 3.1.2.	Assessment
##### 3.1.2.1.	3PAO
All annual security assessments are performed by an independent assessor, called a 3PAO.  3PAOs perform initial and periodic assessment of [System Name] per FedRAMP requirements, provide evidence of compliance, and play an on-going role in ensuring [System Name] meets requirements.  

#### 3.1.3.	Review Findings
Once the assessment has been completed, the 3PAO will provide a copy of the Security Assessment Report (SAR) to the [Company Name] and to the government Authorizing Official (AO).  This SAR contains the results of the comprehensive security test and evaluation of the Information System Abbreviation system.  This assessment report and the results are provided in support of [System Name] Security Authorization program goals, efforts, and activities necessary to achieve compliance with FedRAMP security requirements.  The SAR describes the risks associated with the vulnerabilities identified during the Information System Name security assessment and also serves as the risk summary report as referenced in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications (SP) 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems.  
All assessment results have been analyzed to provide both the government information system owner, [Company Name], and the AO with an assessment of the controls that safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data hosted by the system as described in the Information System Abbreviation System Security Plan (SSP).  
[Company Name]’s Security Operations Team will review the findings and check validity.  
#### 3.1.4.	Develop Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms)
Please see the FedRAMP Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) Template Completion Guide on the Templates page: https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/templates-2016/

#### 3.1.5.	Remediation
### 3.2.	System Interconnections
#### 3.2.1.	Authorization of connections
#### 3.2.2.	Documentation of connections
#### 3.2.3.	Annual review and update of connections
### 3.3.	Security Authorization
#### 3.3.1.	Government AO
#### 3.3.2.	Significant change
The security assessments are performed annually, or when there is a “significant change” to the system. Significant change is defined in NIST Special Publication 800-37 Revision 1, Appendix F, Page F-7.  Significant change is defined as a change that is likely to affect the security state of an information system. Significant changes to an information system may include for example:
(i)	installation of a new or upgraded operating system, middleware component, or application;
(ii)	modifications to system ports, protocols, or services;
(iii)	installation of a new or upgraded hardware platform;
(iv)	modifications to cryptographic modules or services; or
(v)	modifications to security controls.

Examples of significant changes to the environment of operation may include for example:
(i)	moving to a new facility;
(ii)	adding new core missions or business functions;
(iii)	acquiring specific and credible threat information that the organization is being targeted by a threat source; or
(iv)	establishing new/modified laws, directives, policies, or regulations.

### 3.4.	Continuous Monitoring
#### 3.4.1.	Metrics
#### 3.4.2.	Monthly Vulnerability scanning – OS, DB, web
#### 3.4.3.	Quarterly configuration scan
#### 3.4.4.	Continuous monitoring
#### 3.4.5.	Reporting
#### 3.4.6.	Remediation
#### 3.4.7.	Confirmation scans
### 3.5.	Penetration Testing

Additional FedRAMP penetration testing guidance can be found on the FedRAMP Documents page: https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents-2016/

### 3.6.	Internal System Connections
#### 3.6.1.	Authorization of connections
#### 3.6.2.	Documentation of connections
#### 3.6.3.	Annual review and update of connections
